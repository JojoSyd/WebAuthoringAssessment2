	<h1>Adaptations</h1>
	<h3>The OVAs</h3>
	<p>With any popular series comes an adaptation or several, and in the case of JoJo's, the fist one happened very early on. In 1993, an OVA, Original Video Animation, was released of the second half of Stardust Crusaders with 6 episodes. This was followed up with a prequel series in 2001 with a 7 episode span showing the first half of the series, but due to the length of it, there were many plot points changed or dropped completely, namely many of the minor antagonists in the first half.</p>
	<p>In later 2017 the other OVA began - an adaptation of Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe, and his adventures. There have only been two episodes as of present, Episode 5: Millionaire Village, released in 2017; and Episode 2: Mutsu-Kabe Hill, released in 2018. There are another 7 stories, but they have yet to be adapted.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Films</h3>
	<p>An adaptation of the first Part, Phantom Blood, was released as a film in 2007 to commemorate the author's, Hirohiko Araki, 25th anniversary of being a manga artist. However, the film had a very limited release and was never re-released on any sort of media since, but there are reportedly a very high number of differences compared to the source material, most notable being a lack of beloved character, Robert Speedwagon, as well as most fight scenes.</p>
	<p>A second film adaptation was released in 2017, this time being the first couple of story arcs of Part 4 - Diamond is Unbreakable. It recieved reasonable attention in Japan, grossing over 200 million yen in total, and got a home video release as well. There were some differences to the film compared to the source material, namely some character introductions were made earlier, like Yukako and Sheer Heart Attack.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Anime</h3>
	<p>In late 2012, David Production began an anime adaptation of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, with the first season covering Parts 1 and 2, and it got an official English dub as well. The anime was met with high praise from fans across the 26 episode run, and people were excited for the next Part to be adapted, particularly as there were few changes from the source material, which many felt only improved the quality of the story telling.</p>
	<p>In early 2014, David Production began the second season of their adaptation of JoJo's, which covered Stardust Crusaders across 48 episodes. There was a 3 month break in the middle, with the second half gaining the subtitle Battle in Egypt, as well as a new opening song and ending song as well. Again, the adaptation was met with praise from fans due to the loving handling of the source material.</p>
	<p>In early 2016, David Production returned yet again for the third season of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, this time covering Part 4, Diamond is Unbreakable, in a 39 episode season. The artstyle was very different compared to the previous two seasons, but that's because of the art evolution that Hirohiko Araki went through during Part 4. Like the previous seasons, this adaptation was also met with high praise from fans, although there was a little complaint of some animation quality, but was fixed for the Blu-Ray release.</p>
	<p>In late 2018, David Production returned for a fourth time to begin the fourth season, this time being for Vento Aureo. Scheduled to have 39 episodes, like the previous seasons, the Part 5 adaptation has also been met with high praise as of this point, especially the infamous "torture dance" sequence, which was even better than people expected.</p>
