	<h1>Games</h1>
	<p>As with many series that gain popularity it's not unnatural for it to get a video game based on it.</p>
	<h3>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</h3>
	<p>Released in 1993 for the Super Famicom and never localised outside of Japan, this game is a point and click adventure game mixed with some rpg elements using a card based system; mostly based on the story of Stardust Crusaders, but with some differences in terms of plots and progression due to the medium that it is present as.</p>
	<h3>JoJo's Venture/JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future/JoJo's Bizarre Adventure HD</h3>
	<p>Depending on where you play this fighing game based on Stardust Crusaders, you'll play a slightly version. JoJo's Venture is the basic arcade version that was released in 1998. This got updated with several more characters added in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future, which was released in 1999 for the Playstation and the Dreamcast. The game was rereleased in 2012 as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure HD for the Playstation Netwok and Xbox Live Arcade. The most notable thing about this game is the close involvement that Hirohiko Araki had with it, namely creating a brand new character design for Midler, a minor antagonist from halfway through Part 3 as she hadn't had a concrete character design.</p>
	<h3>GioGio's Bizarre Adventure</h3>
	<p>An action adventure game for the Playstation 2 released in 2002, this essentially follows the story of Part 5: Vento Aureo. All of the protagonists from Part 5 are playable, which marks the only time that Abbacchio is playable in any game. While much of the game is battle focused, there are also some puzzles in the game to solve as well.</p>
	<h3>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood</h3>
	<p>Released in 2006 for the Playstation 2, this game follows the plot of Phantom Blood heavily. It is a fighting game that has a number of different characters to be played as that depends on the mode that is selected to play through.</p>

	<p>Released in 2015, and getting an international release in 2016 for the Playstation 4, Eyes of Heaven is a fighting game similar to All Star Battle, featuring 53 playable characters from across the whole series.
