	<h1>Part 3: Stardust Crusaders</h1>
	<p>Released in 1989 to 1992 taking up 12 volumes, Part 3 follows the story of Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese teenage delinquent. Joined by his grandfather, Joseph Joestar, and a number of other characters, Jotaro must travel to Egypt to defeat the newly revived DIO, in order to save his mother. Rather than have the power of hamon, Jotaro instead has the power of a Stand - Star Platinum, which gives him great abilities, but so do all his enemies.</p>

	<h4>The Fool</h4>
	<img src="Assets/Fool.png">
	<p>Iggy is the last of the main characters to join the Crusaders. While only being a dog, his stand, The Fool, is very strong as it has control over sand and can change it's form into whatever it wants to be, whether in be an illusion of someone, or a hang-glider. Iggy slowly warms up to the Crusaders over time and becomes a valuable member of the team.</p>
	<h4>Hol Horse</h4>
	<img src="Assets/HolHorse.jpg">
	<h4>Emperor</h4>
	<img src="Assets/Emperor.png">
	<p>A cowardly man who prefers to be number two, Hol Horse encounters the Crusaders a number of times on their journey to Egypt. His stand, Emperor, is a gun that he can control the bullets of. While not being a very strong stand on it's own, it is very good when it is paired with another stand that can be more directional in combat.</p>
	<h4>J. Geil</h4>
	<img src="Assets/JGeil.png">
	<h4>Hanged Man</h4>
	<img src="Assets/HMan.png">
	<p>The man that killed and raped Polnareff's sister Sherry, J. Geil is truly a horrible person. His stand, Hanged Man, appears in reflections and stabs people with it's knife in order to kill them. J. Geil is recognisable by his two right hands.</p>
	<h4>Enya the Hag</h4>
	<img src="Assets/Enya.jpg">
	<h4>Justice</h4>
	<img src="Assets/Justice.png">
	<p>Enya serves as DIO's advisor throughout much of Part 3, and is the one who gives him his stand. Being the mother of J. Geil, she flies into a frenzy once she learns the fate of her son, and so uses her stand, Justice, to try and destroy all of the Crusaders. Justice's ability is to control someone by entering any wounds on a person's body, but there doesn't seem to be a limit on how many it can control at once.</p>
	<h4>Vanilla Ice</h4>
	<img src="Assets/Vanilla Ice.png">
	<h4>Cream</h4>
	<img src="Assets/Cream.png">
	<p>Being DIO's most loyal follower, he acts as the final challenge before the Crusaders can reach DIO. Being a vampire, and having one of the most dangerous stands in the whole series, Vanilla Ice is incredibly formidable. His stand, Cream, allows for Vanilla Ice to hide in another dimension and eat all matter and remove it from this plane of existance, be it wall, floor or human alike.</h4>
	<h4>DIO</h4>
	<img src="Assets/DIO.jpg">
	<h4>The World</h4>
	<img src="Assets/TheWorld.png">
	<p>The main villain of Part 3, the revived DIO survives the events of Part 1 by stealing Jonathan's body for his own. After receiving his stand, The World, from Enya and a stand arrow, DIO begins to grow more powerful. The power of The World is the power to stop time for brief intervals, but it gets longer the more times he uses it. This makes DIO one truly formidable enemy.</p>
