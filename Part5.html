	<h4>Gold Experience Requiem</h4>
	<img src="Assets/GER.png">
	<p>Giorno Giovanna dreams of becoming a Gang Star. Being the son of DIO, he had no father figure to look up to until he saved the life of a gang member when he was younger, who then protected him. This gave him the inspiration to join the gang Passione and become the Boss. His stand, Gold Experience, allows Giorno to give life to inanimate objects like bricks or bags, or to heal people. Early on in the Part he also has a damage reflection technique, as well as the ability to cause a person's senses to go haywire.</p>

	<img src="Assets/Bruno.png">
	<h4>Sticky Fingers</h4>
	<img src="Assets/SFingers.jpg">
	<p>Bruno Bucciarati is a member of Passione. After being a regular member for a while, he eventually becomes a Caporegime after a certain accident. Once he becomes Capo, he and his assembled team are tasked by the Boss to take care of his daughter, Trish and to bring her to him.

His stand, Moody Blues, allows him to view the actions of a person by creating an exact copy of the actions through a rewind, which allows him to learn information about mysterious stand abilities.</p>

Due to his experience as a doctor, he knows what parts of the body can be removed without any major damage, and then can use Green Day to reanimate the removed body parts to attack individually of Cioccolata.

Diavolo's stand is King Crimson, a very strong stand that can forsee 10 seconds into the future, and can also erase time for others, for a 10 second period whereby he removes the cause from an action so people except him are locked into their predetermind actions, but he can fully control his own, and then the period of removed time is removed from all around's memories but the effects of the actions are still valid.</p>
