	<img src="Assets/S&W.png">
	<p>The main protagonist of Part 8, Josuke Higashikata is a man with no memory. After being found by Yasuho Hirose, he is adopted by the kindly Higashikata, who name him. He travels through Morioh to try and discover who he is, but it's not long until he has his first encouter with the Rock People, humanoid people that are actually made of rock, and battles them to discover the mysteries of the Rokakaka fruit. His stand, Soft & Wet, creates bubbles, which Josuke can use to either attack or to steal things, whether it be physical things, or abstract concepts like friction on the floor.</p>

	<img src="Assets/Yasuho.jpg">
	<h4>Paisley Park</h4>
	<img src="Assets/PP.png">
	<p>Yasuho Hirose is initially Joshu's crush, but she realises that she likes Josuke more. She is the one to first find Josuke and so she spends much of the part helping him to work out who he is. She also spends a fair amount of time with other members of the Higashikata family, in particular Tsurugi. She is able to help out with her stand, Paisley Park, which can gain sorts of information from electronics and also be a guide with maps.</p>
	<h4>Joshu Higashikata</h4>

	<h4>Nut King Call</h4>
	<img src="Assets/NKCall.png">
	<p>Joshu Higashikata is the third child of the Higashikata family and he believes that he has a romantic relationship with Yasuho - he doesn't. Joshu feels envy towards Josuke for coming into their home and treats him as a rival of sorts, even though there have been a few occasions when Josuke and Joshu have worked together. Joshu develops a stand part way through the story, Nut King Call, which can be used to disassemble objects or people by placing a nut and bolt on an object and unscrewing. He can put the object back together, but only if he repairs it properly.</p>

	<img src="Assets/DStyle.png">
	<p>Rai Mamezuku is a botanist who secretly works in the Higashikata Fruit Company, and is enlisted to help search for the Rokakaka branch by Josuke and Yasuho. He uses his stand, Doggy Style, to assist him with this, as it allows him to create string around his body to either grab things from a distance, or to unravel parts of himself to protect himself.</p>
